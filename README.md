Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. 
OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. 

In this project I am using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.

You need to download the trained classifier XML file (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml), which is available in OpenCVâ€™s GitHub repository (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades). It is also available in this project. Save it to your working location.
