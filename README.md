Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.
You need to download the trained classifier XML file (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml), which is available in OpenCvâ€™s GitHub repository. Save it to your working location.
